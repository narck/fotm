# Instructions
If you do not have Maven, download it. You can also use a bundled Maven if you use some IDE like NetBeans. You can run the app through the IDE as well, if you have a server like Tomcat installed.

If you already have Maven, to run the app, you need simply clone the source and run the following in jlab/:
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar <--port {number}> target/<war package>.war

After jetty-runner is launched (you see SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080 STARTING), open your browser at localhost:8080.
