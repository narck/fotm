The class structure is as follows:

# FotmServlet (in Servlet)
FotmServlet is the user-facing class. It handles all requests.
It also contains the TwitterEvaluator service and the TwitterHistory repository, to which it communicates. It passes data to TwitterHistory for caching.

# TwitterHistory (in Repo)
Simply a list repository of cached tweets. It gives results based on the repository status, such as latest result, this month's favourite, and can return a list for other classes to use. Uses TwitterCache objects to store into the cache.

# TwitterEvaluator implements EvaluatorService (in Service)
This class is responsible for communicating with the Twitter API. It sends requests, gets responses and sends the responses for evaluation to TwitterCrunch. It passes data as a String object further to the servlet.

#TwitterCrunch (in Logic)
This class is a helper class for TwitterEvaluator, to determine which hashtag is the top trending #1 of a list of hashtags, based on their latest 100 tweets. Only TwitterEvaluator has access to this class.

#TwitterCache (in Data)
A simple datatype to store a hashtag and a Date when the cache was set. Used in TwitterHistory.
